Cplcfg finds the complement of a .cfg with respect to the number of
bones in a live animal.  If {\em home.cfg\/} describes the bones that are
transported home, then cplcfg can be used to calculate a description
of the bones that were not transported.
\begin{verbatim}
  Usage: cplcfg filename.bdf filename.cfg
\end{verbatim}

where {\em filename.bdf\/} is a bone definition file (in .bdf format) and
{\em filename.cfg\/} is an agent configuration file (in .cfg format).  The
output is another .cfg file.  Given this .bdf file:
\begin{verbatim}
  #################### toy.bdf #####################################
  2   #number of parts
  #label          live    density
  Skull           1       0.49
  Femur           2       0.37
\end{verbatim}

and this .cfg file:
\begin{verbatim}
  #################### home.cfg ##################################
  2  #number of parts
  5   #number of configurations
  #
  #probabilities of configurations:
                0.5   0.2   0.15    0.1    0.05
  #
  #Configurations:
  #label 
  Skull         0     0     1       1      1
  Femur         1     2     2       1      0
\end{verbatim}

the following command:
\begin{verbatim}
  cplcfg toy.bdf home.cfg
\end{verbatim}

will produce the following output:
\begin{verbatim}
       2  # number of parts
       5  # number of configurations
  #Probabilities of configurations are proportional to:
                     10 4 3 2 1
  #label
  Skull              1  1  0  0  0
  Femur              1  0  0  1  2
\end{verbatim}

which also in the form of a .cfg file.  Note the configurations in the
new .cfg file and those of the old one each sum to produce the number
of bones in a live animal, as given by {\em toy.bdf\/}.  Thus, if
{\em home.cfg\/} describes the number of bones brought home from a kill
site, then cplcfg tells us the number that were left at the kill site.
