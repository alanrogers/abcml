Agents of deposition can be described in either of two formats.  The
.mau file format divides the number of each skeletal part by the
number of that part in a living animal, and the .cfg uses raw counts.
Many published data are .mau format, but the other programs in this
package require .cfg format.  Thus, it is often necessary to translate
from .mau to .cfg and this program does that job.  mau2cfg must also
read a file in .bdf format, which describes the skeletal parts of
living animals.  See {\em files\/} for descriptions of these formats.
\begin{verbatim}
  Usage: mau2cfg filename.bdf filename.mau
\end{verbatim}

where {\em filename.bdf\/} is the bone definition file and {\em filename.mau\/}
the .mau file.  These files must have extensions .bdf and .mau,
respectively, but the filenames are otherwise arbitrary.

The program's output is in the form of a .cfg file.
