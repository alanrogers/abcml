MAU2CFG Documentation File
    Agents of deposition can be described in either of two formats.
    The .mau file format divides the number of each skeletal part by
    the number of that part in a living animal, and the .cfg uses
    raw counts. Many published data are .mau format, but the other
    programs in this package require .cfg format. Thus, it is often
    necessary to translate from .mau to .cfg and this program does
    that job. mau2cfg must also read a file in .bdf format, which
    describes the skeletal parts of living animals. See files for
    descriptions of these formats.

      Usage: mau2cfg filename.bdf filename.mau

    where filename.bdf is the bone definition file and filename.mau
    the .mau file. These files must have extensions .bdf and .mau,
    respectively, but the filenames are otherwise arbitrary.

    The program's output is in the form of a .cfg file.
