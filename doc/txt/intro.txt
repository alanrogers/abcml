    Each documentation file is provided in several formats:

    `pod'     Perl's "pod" format. Pod is a very simple text formatting
              language that can be translated automatically into the
              other formats listed here for documentation files.
              Files in this format are collected in the doc/pod
              directory and have suffix .pod.

    `txt'     Plain text format. These files are collected in the
              doc/txt directory and have suffix .txt.

    `tex'     LaTeX format. To view these files, you must use the LaTeX
              typesetting program. These files are collected in the
              doc/tex directory and have suffix .tex.

    `html'    This is the format understood by net browsers such as
              Netscape and Internet Explorer. These files are
              collected in the doc/html directory and have suffix
              .html (on Mac and unix-like systems) or .htm (on
              Microsoft systems).
