ABCSIM Documentation File
    Abcsim is a program that generates one or more simulated
    archeological data sets using data from input files and from the
    command line. It requires the following input files.

    1.   A bone definition file, whose name ends with .bdf. This file
         describes the characteristics of the skeletal parts to be
         analyzed.

    2.   Two or more agent definition files, each having a name ending
         with .cfg. Each of these files describes an agent of
         deposition.

    The format of these files is described in files.

    In addition, the program recognizes the following command line
    options:

    `-a x,x,...,x'
         Sets the vector of alpha values to the comma-separated
         string of numbers given as an argument. alpha[i] is the
         fraction of the assemblage attributable to the i'th agent
         of deposition. By default, all the entries of alpha have
         the same value.

    `-b x'
         Set beta, the attrition parameter. This determines how
         strongly the simulated assemblages will be affected by
         attrition. When `beta=0', no bones are lost to attrition.
         When `beta=1', half the bones in a complete skeleton would
         be lost. By default, `beta=0' so that no bones are lost.

    `-K x'
         Set number of animals in assemblage. Def: 100

    `-n x'
         Set number of simulated datasets. Def: 1

    For example, to generate two data sets using the input files in
    the toy directory, and with `beta=.3', type:

      abcsim toy.bdf home.cfg kill.cfg -n 2 -b 0.3

    This generates two random data sets, which are written to output
    in .cnt format. Here is a sample set of output:

        2 #number of parts
        2 #number of data sets
      #label              DS0  DS1
      Skull                37   49
      Femur                88   84

    The simulations are done by generating `alpha[i]*K' animals from
    agent `i'. Each animal is generated by choosing a configuration
    with the probabilities given in the relevant .cfg file, and then
    adding the relevant skeletal parts to the data set. Then, each
    skeletal part is exposed to attrition. A skeletal part of type
    `j' survives attrition with independent probability

         exp(-beta*s[j])

    where `s[i]' is the sensitivity of the jth skeletal part and is
    proportional to the reciprocal of the density of this skeletal
    part, as given in the .bdf file. The constant of proportionality
    is adjusted so that on average, half the bones in a complete
    skeleton would survive when `beta=1'.
